These are the projects I completed during my first year learning to code.

Each project requires django in order to run.

In the terminal, change into each directory by executing 'cd mail' to view the mail app, for example.

Once in the app directory, execute "python manage.py runserver" to launch a localhost address in which you can test out the app.
